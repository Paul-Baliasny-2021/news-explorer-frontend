This is my final project called "News Explorer" in the course of web development by Yandex Practicum100.

The project allows users to easily find and read the latest news in English from news agencies from around the world by any topic that a user enters in the search form. 
Those users who choose to register may also save the articles they find the most interesting/relevant to their "Saved articles" page. 

The app is available at the following URL:

https://news-storage-chest.students.nomoreparties.sbs/

The app is created using MERN stack and deployed to the Google Cloud Platform.

The back-end part of the project is available at https://api.news-storage-chest.students.nomoreparties.sbs/
