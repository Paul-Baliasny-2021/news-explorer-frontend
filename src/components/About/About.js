                <p className='about__text'>Hi, my name is Pavel (Paul) Baliasny. For the past few months Iâ€™ve been studying web development alongside my wonderful fellow students and tutors from Yandex Practicum 100.</p>
                <p className='about__text'>Those were rather tough months full of hard learning, great insights, euphoric achievements and severe challenges, especially for someone with no technical background as myself. I believe with hard persistent work and never-ending learning I can become a valuable member of a web development team.</p>
